# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. first use import statment
2. second use the numpy oparator
3. third use the print statment
4. i got the output

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
/*

```
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```
/*
Program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

```

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
